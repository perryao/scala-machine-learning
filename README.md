# Overview
This repository is a playground for applying principles
learned in the Coursera Machine Learning course with the
Scala programming language.

I'll be trying out Breeze and DeepLearning4j to get a feel
for how these libraries work.


# Running the projects
Mill is used to run the projects in this repo. To run the
linear regression example that uses Breeze, execute:

    $ mill linearreg.run
